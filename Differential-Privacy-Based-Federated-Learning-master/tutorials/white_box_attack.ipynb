    "The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of samples used in each iteration when computing the signals. Larger batch sizes can increase computation speed, but they also consume more memory. If you're computing the loss, you can use a larger batch size, but if you're using the GPU to compute gradient information such as gradient norm, using a batch size that is too large may result in an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. This is largely dependent on the size of your model and the memory capacity of your GPU. As a general guideline, we recommend using a batch size of 10 when computing gradient information"

The results based on the loss indicate the privacy risk of the model in a black-box setting, where the adversary does not have access to the entire model. Conversely, computing the gradient norm per sample requires the adversary to have access to the entire model parameters, which corresponds to a white-box setting."
